📖 About the Project
Bite Decoded is a responsive web project designed to "deconstruct" the nutritional facts behind popular fast food and comfort meals. Rather than boring spreadsheets, this project visualizes macros and ingredients using a playful "fast food" aesthetic combined with clean data typography.

The goal is to make nutritional transparency accessible, engaging, and easy to digest.

✨ Key Features
Visual Data Breakdowns: Nutritional stats are presented using "deconstructed" visual elements rather than plain text.

Thematic Design: A unique UI that blends a "French Fry" aesthetic (using rounded, golden visuals) with a scientific "Data Lab" feel.

Responsive Layout: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.


🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid)

Design: SVG Icons, Google Fonts

Hosting: Netlify

Version Control: Git & GitHub

=======
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Mapbox setup

This project can use Mapbox GL for the interactive map in `src/components/Map.js`.

- Sign up for a free Mapbox account at https://www.mapbox.com/ and get an access token.
- Create a `.env` file in the project root with this line (never commit secrets to git):

```
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
```

After adding the token, restart the dev server (`npm start`) so Create React App picks up the environment variable.

If you prefer not to use Mapbox, remove the token and the map component will skip initialization.
