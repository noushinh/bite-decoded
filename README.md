📖 About the Project

Bite Decoded is a responsive web project designed to "deconstruct" the nutritional facts behind popular fast food and comfort meals. Rather than boring spreadsheets, this project visualizes macros and ingredients using a playful "fast food" aesthetic combined with clean data typography.

The goal is to make nutritional transparency accessible, engaging, and easy to digest.

✨ Key Features
Visual Data Breakdowns: Nutritional stats are presented using "deconstructed" visual elements rather than plain text.

Thematic Design: A unique UI that blends a "French Fry" aesthetic (using rounded, golden visuals) with a scientific "Data Lab" feel.

Responsive Layout: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.


🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid)
